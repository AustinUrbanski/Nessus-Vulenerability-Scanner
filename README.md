<h1>Nessus Vulnerability Scanner</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
For this project I setup a virtual machine and intentionally turned off all security features and downloaded vulnerable software onto the machine. I then used Nessus to perform a vulnerability scan on the machine and remediated the vulnerabilities. Below is a link to the google slides show I made for the project going more into detail about what steps I took throught the whole process. Because the project had so many steps and was very methodical it was more practical for me to create a slide show of it instead of describing everything I did through GitHub. I had a lot of fun on this project and was able to learn a lot about Nessus and how powerful it can be. <br />

<h2>Environments Used</h2>

- Windows 10
- Server 2019 ISO
